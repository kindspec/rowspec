The sidecar's `key` is `id` followed by U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE. The CSV's
first column is `id`, with unique values.

§13: "A sidecar names a column as §9.2 compares names in this profile: after
trimming ASCII space and tab only, and after NFC. So `" joined"` names the
column `joined`, and `""` names a column whose header cell is empty. A name
that is not a string, or that names no column, is refused, whichever member
holds it: a declaration naming nothing is refused rather than skipped,
because skipping it switches off the check it asked for."

Trimming removes ASCII space and tab only, so the name is `id<U+00A0>`,
which no header cell is: it names no column and is refused. A reader that
trims Unicode whitespace finds `id` and accepts this file.

This tree asserts only that the file is refused (`refusal_contains: ""`),
because the CSV profile carries no §9 identifiers yet (§13). The case is
built so that the name naming no column is the only fault in the file and
its sidecar, so a reader that refuses it has refused for that reason or for
one §13 does not give. What the case does not pin is which reason the reader
reports.

## Identifier

This case asserts `refusal: "malformed-declaration"`.

§13: "Every CSV-mode refusal is reported with a §9 identifier, under §9's rules for reporting one. Each refusal this profile makes is read as a §9 entry, as follows, and is reported with that entry's identifier:"

§13: "the sidecar is this profile's set of declarations, so a sidecar that does not parse, or that declares what cannot be checked, is a malformed declaration, §9.12 `malformed-declaration`:"

§13: "a `key` or a `columns` member naming no column of the file. The last is the CSV form of §9.12's `key := col` naming no stored column."

§9.12: "`malformed-declaration`: a malformed declaration — a line containing `:=` that does not match `declaration`, a `key :=` in function form such as `key := by(id)`, or a `key := col` whose `col` is not a stored column of the table: no column of that name, or a computed one (§4.1.11; see §13 for the CSV profile)"

The earlier paragraph on `refusal_contains: ""` describes this case before §13 gave CSV-mode refusals identifiers; it now asserts `malformed-declaration` instead.

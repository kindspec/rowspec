The keys are `b` and `a`, with more leading space before `b`.

§13: "Where the sidecar declares `key` and no `order`, the rows MUST be in ascending order of the key's value as §4.1.8 orders text, or the file is refused (§9.28)."

§4.1.8 compares the trimmed value. Compared with the padding left on, the file would pass.

## Identifier

This case asserts `refusal: "rows-out-of-order"`.

§13: "Every CSV-mode refusal is reported with a §9 identifier, under §9's rules for reporting one. Each refusal this profile makes is read as a §9 entry, as follows, and is reported with that entry's identifier:"

§13: "rows that do not follow the declared `order`, or the `key` where no `order` is declared: §9.28 `rows-out-of-order`."

§9.28: "`rows-out-of-order`: a table that declares a key, and a row whose key does not sort after the key of the row above it, as §4.1.8 orders text (§6). In §13's CSV profile, rows that do not follow the sidecar's `order`, or its `key` where it declares no `order` (§13)"

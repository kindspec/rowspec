`columns` holds `n` and `" n"`, both `number`. `n` holds two numbers.

§13: "A sidecar names a column as §9.2 compares names in this profile: after
trimming ASCII space and tab only, and after NFC. So `" joined"` names the
column `joined`, and `""` names a column whose header cell is empty. A name
that is not a string, or that names no column, is refused, whichever member
holds it: a declaration naming nothing is refused rather than skipped,
because skipping it switches off the check it asked for."

§13: "`columns` declares the type of any stored column, the key and order
columns included: a JSON object whose members map a column name to `number`,
`date` or `text`. Any other type, a non-string included, is refused, and so
is a `columns` that is not an object. Two members naming one column, such as
`café` spelt NFC and NFD, are refused as a repeated member is. Each trimmed
value of a named column is classified as an order value is, and refused when
its type is not the declared one: `text` means a value matching neither
`number` nor `date`, so `5` in a `text` column is refused, and `inf`, which
is text by §4.1.6, is refused in a `number` column and admitted in a `text`
one. A number beyond binary64 matches `number` and is admitted: it is
`#REF!(overflow)` where it is used (§8), and nothing here sorts by it."

`" n"` trims to `n`, so both members name one column and are refused as a
repeated member is.

This tree asserts only that the file is refused (`refusal_contains: ""`),
because the CSV profile carries no §9 identifiers yet (§13). The case is
built so that the two names for one column is the only fault in the file and
its sidecar, so a reader that refuses it has refused for that reason or for
one §13 does not give. What the case does not pin is which reason the reader
reports.

## Identifier

This case asserts `refusal: "duplicate-declaration"`.

§13: "Every CSV-mode refusal is reported with a §9 identifier, under §9's rules for reporting one. Each refusal this profile makes is read as a §9 entry, as follows, and is reported with that entry's identifier:"

§13: "a member repeated within one object of the sidecar, and two `columns` members naming one column: §9.4 `duplicate-declaration`."

§9.4: "`duplicate-declaration`: a duplicate `key` or `order` declaration (see §13 for the CSV profile)"

The earlier paragraph on `refusal_contains: ""` describes this case before §13 gave CSV-mode refusals identifiers; it now asserts `duplicate-declaration` instead.

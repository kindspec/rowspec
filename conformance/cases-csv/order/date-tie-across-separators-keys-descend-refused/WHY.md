`2024/1/5` and `2024-01-05` are one date (§4.1.7).

§13: "The rows MUST be in ascending order of the tuple `(typed value of the column, key)`, numbers by value, dates by year, month and day, text and the key as §4.1.8 orders text, or the file is refused (§9.28). A row may hold the same order value as the row above it, when its key sorts after that row's."

A tie on the date is broken by key.

The twin `order/date-tie-across-separators-keys-ascend-accepted` is accepted.

## Identifier

This case asserts `refusal: "rows-out-of-order"`.

§13: "Every CSV-mode refusal is reported with a §9 identifier, under §9's rules for reporting one. Each refusal this profile makes is read as a §9 entry, as follows, and is reported with that entry's identifier:"

§13: "rows that do not follow the declared `order`, or the `key` where no `order` is declared: §9.28 `rows-out-of-order`."

§9.28: "`rows-out-of-order`: a table that declares a key, and a row whose key does not sort after the key of the row above it, as §4.1.8 orders text (§6). In §13's CSV profile, rows that do not follow the sidecar's `order`, or its `key` where it declares no `order` (§13)"
